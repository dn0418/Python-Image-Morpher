# Image Morpher
This is my personal project that began as a final assignment in Purdue University's ECE 36400 - Software Engineering Tools Lab. 

What began in Spring 2019 (detailed in <b>readme_general.pdf</b> and <b>readme_phase_1.pdf</b>) required the usage of <b>delaunay triangulation</b>, <b>projective/affine transformatio</b>n, <b>application of projections through matrices</b>, <b>masking,</b> and <b>alpha blending</b> - all of which are still maintained with this project - in order to accomplish image morphing. [A custom GUI](https://github.com/ddowd97/Morphing/blob/master/readme_phase_2.pdf) was additionally required in order for users to place their own points to be used with the matrix math involved with this program.
