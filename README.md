# Image Morpher
This is my personal project that began as a final assignment in Purdue University's ECE 36400 - Software Engineering Tools Lab. 

What began in Spring 2019 (detailed in <b>readme_general.pdf</b>, <b>readme_phase_1.pdf</b>, and <b>readme_phase_2.pdf</b>) required the usage of <b>delaunay triangulation</b>, <b>projective/affine transformatio</b>n, <b>application of projections through matrices</b>, <b>masking,</b> and <b>alpha blending</b> - all of which are still maintained with this project - in order to accomplish image morphing. A custom GUI was additionally required in order for users to place their own points to be used with the matrix math involved with this program.

Now that I'm no longer in this course and the source code is mine to freely modify, I've taken it upon myself to improve this image morphing application in my leisure as a for-fun project. At the time of the creation of this README, meaningful changes include (but are, in no capacity, limited to):

* Color Image Compatibility
* Multiprocessing
* GUI Overhaul
* Resizing
* And other general cleanup, bugfixes, etc.

In the future, I plan to further improve this neat program. :)
